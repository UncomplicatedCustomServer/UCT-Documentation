### Features

* Define spawn waves, spawn positions, and custom roles
* Configure Cassie announcements for each team
* Support for custom audio announcements (requires [AudioPlayerAPI](https://github.com/Killers0992/AudioPlayerApi))
* Adjustable team spawn chances and player limits
* Easy configuration through YAML files
